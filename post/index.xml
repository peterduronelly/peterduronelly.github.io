      <description>The Beatles became hit through its powerful music but it is not famous for its poetry. But the group&amp;rsquo;s lyrics did change during the band&amp;rsquo;s short existence and we can use text analysis to track these changes. This post is about measuring the change in the complexity of the group&amp;rsquo;s lyrics, from Please, Please Me to Abbey Road, showing how we can use basic data secience tools to find really fancy patterns in unstructured text data.</description>

      <description>One of the things we need to manage in data analysis is recources. When we have large amounts of (&amp;lsquo;big&amp;rsquo;) data this can become a serious issue. One of the cases when we need to consider whether we really need all the data we have is when we have a lot of zeros in our database, and these zeroes happen to be irrelevant for our calculations. Python&amp;rsquo;s SciPy library has a solution to store and handle sparse data matrices which contain a large number of irrelevant zero values.</description>

      <description>Who Am I? I am originally trainded as an economist with a Finance major and a Statistics minor. I spent 21 years on financial markets as an analyst and asset manager. After a while, though, I got interested in disruptive technologies, mostly data and data science, which are closely linked to my previous academic studies. Statistics is especially close to my heart as I used to teach it to sophomore students on the Budapest University of Economics (currently Corvinus University).</description>
