<p>The Beatles became a hit through its sometimes simple but always powerful music but it has never been famous for its poetry. The group&rsquo;s
lyrics, however, did change during the band&rsquo;s short existence and we can use text analysis to track these changes.
This post is about measuring the change in the complexity of the group&rsquo;s lyrics, from the Please, Please Me
to the Abbey Road albums, showing how we can use basic data secience tools to find really fancy patterns in unstructured
text data.</p>

<p>This piece is a shortened version of a final project for a Data Science
on Unstructured Text Data course held by Facebook&rsquo;s Eduardo Ari√±o de la
Rubia. The course introduced the tidytext package and the basics of text
analysis in R. At the end of the course students had to present their
skills through a freely chosen analysis project. Although tidytext does
not directly cover text complexity, to me it was somehow an obvious
choice.</p>

<p>This is a technical post, but most of the hard stuff is concentrated in the
code blocks. If you are only interested in the power of data science, feel free
to disregard these blocks and concentrate on the text and the plots only. You
will still be able to get the message.</p>

<p>When you learn English as a foreign language you inevitably bump into
The Beatles early on. The songs are well known, and even a beginner
student can easily understand the lyrics. This is not only because the
members were singing in nice English, but because their early text is
damned simple. &lsquo;She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah.&rsquo; Not that of a
challenging text, right?</p>

<p>But when you listen to The Beatles a little more, you realize that as
time went by their songs got more and more sophisticated. &lsquo;Strawberry
Fields Forever&rsquo; does have more depth than &lsquo;A Hard Day&rsquo;s Night&rsquo;. Since we
are into data science, it is obvious to ask: can we measure this change
in sophistication? Can we trace the development also in their lyrics? As
the members went from their early twenties towards their thirties, did
they move from their simple but powerful origins towards something more
mature?</p>

<p>In the next few lines I am analyzing The Beatles&rsquo; thirteen albums of
&lsquo;core catalogues&rsquo; from &lsquo;Please Please Me&rsquo; to &lsquo;Let It Be&rsquo;, published
between 1964 and 1970. It is amazing but the most influential pop group
of all times existed for less than a decade, and this short period was
enough to issue thirteen albums and to turn the world upside down. The
group had quite a few extra collections, live recordings and greatest
hit compilations (the last one, according to wikipedia, in 2013), but
these thirteen albums make up the the actual works of the group.</p>

<p>For the project I used the newly developed <a href="https://github.com/JosiahParry/geniusR" target="_blank">geniusR package</a> by Josiah Parry, which downloads lyrics and
metadata from the genius.com homepage. This package was of enormous help
for the analysis.
<br><br></p>

<h2 id="a-glance-at-the-beatles">A Glance At The Beatles</h2>

<p>As a starter I imported the necessary packages. I like starting all
analysis with the packages, having them in one single chunk for a better
overview. Also, when I later need to add further packages I just scroll
back to the first chunk to enter the extra library command.</p>

<pre><code class="language-.r">library(geniusR)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
library(tidyr)
library(tibble)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(stringr)
library(syllable)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(gridExtra)
library(lsa)
library(rlist)
library(data.table)
</code></pre>

<p>Downloading the text is simple with geniusR: you define the artist, the
number of albums to download, and the album titles. Album titles should
be entered as the last part of the urls on the genius.com webpage
without hyphens. Apostrophes are omitted. You can also download albums
of multiple artists entering the author, # of albums multiple
times as a vector. See the documentation and Josiah&rsquo;s github for
details.</p>

<p>It takes a while until your text downloads, but you end up with a nice
(tidy!) tibble which serves as the basis for further analysis.</p>

<pre><code class="language-.r">albums &lt;-  tibble(
  artist = 
    rep(&quot;The Beatles&quot;, 13),
  album = c(
    &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, &quot;With The Beatles&quot;, &quot;A Hard Day s Night&quot;,
    &quot;Beatles For Sale&quot;, &quot;Help&quot;, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;,
    &quot;Revolver&quot;, &quot;Sgt Pepper s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;,
    &quot;The Beatles The White Album&quot;, &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;, &quot;Abbey Road&quot;,
    &quot;Let It Be&quot;
  )

beatles_lyrics &lt;- album_lyrics %&gt;% 
  unnest(tracks) 

beatles_albums &lt;- beatles_lyrics %&gt;%
  distinct(album)
</code></pre>

<p>As the most obvious starting point of any text analysis, I checked the
per album frequencies of non-stop words across these albums. (For the wider
audience: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words" target="_blank">stop words</a> are the most common, &lsquo;functional&rsquo; words in a language.) In order to
draw an arch of change, I plotted simple word frequency charts for
Please Please Me (1963), Help (1965), Magical Mystery Tour (1967) and
Let It Be (1970). Can we see any difference in the words used?</p>

<p>Love makes it into the first 10 in three of the albums, leading the pack
in Please Please Me and, to my little surprise, Magical Mystery Tour.
Interestingly, it is missing from the top 10 in Let It Be, the last
album. It looks, love was not of primary interest by 1970, the year when
the members decided to go their own separate ways. Of course, per album
word frequency depends largely on the songs&rsquo; topic selection: &lsquo;mother&rsquo;
goes to number 2 in Magical Mystery Tour due to the many repetitions of
the line &lsquo;Your mother should know&rsquo; in the song of the same title.</p>

<p>This simple exercise shows that working with lyrics can be very tricky.
Lines are repeated very often, and melody dominates sentence building.
As a matter of fact, sentences can only be poorly defined by regular
text analysis algorithms in songs, which, as we will see later, makes
measuring text complexity somewhat difficult.
<br><br></p>

<h2 id="measuring-similarity-across-core-albums">Measuring Similarity Across Core Albums</h2>

<p>In order to asses how much the group changed over the course of these
seven years I measured the similarity of each album to Please Please Me,
the very first LP. More and more sophisticated lyrics would result in
larger and larger differences in text, measured by cosine similarity.</p>

<p>I calculated cosine similarity based on word frequency vectors, where
each album is vector of frequencies of words in a union of sets of words
from each album. The word list is a product of a full join of all words
from the all the albums, and the cosine for each album is a similarity
measure between that particular album and the benchmark Please Please
Me. This word list excludes stop words, of course.</p>

<pre><code class="language-.r">cos &lt;- tidy_beatles %&gt;%
  select(album, word, freq)

cos_w &lt;- spread(cos, key = album, value = freq) # This is a matrix where entries are frequencies of words in the the various albums. NAs are replaced by zeros in the next command. 

cos_w[is.na(cos_w)] &lt;- 0

cos_w &lt;- cos_w %&gt;%
  select(-word)

title &lt;- beatles_albums[[1]][1]
a &lt;- cos_w %&gt;% select(as.character(title))


cosines &lt;- data.table(album = character(),
                      cosines = numeric())

for(i in 2:nrow(beatles_albums)){
  title1 &lt;- beatles_albums[[1]][i]
  l &lt;- list(title1)
  b &lt;- cos_w %&gt;% select(as.character(title1))
  l &lt;- list.append(l, round(sum(a*b)/sqrt(sum(a^2)*sum(b^2)),3))
  cosines &lt;- rbind(cosines, l)
}

cosines &lt;- data.frame(cosines)

cosines &lt;- cosines%&gt;%
  arrange(desc(cosines))

cosines$album &lt;- factor(cosines$album, levels = cosines$album[order(cosines$cosines)])

ggplot(cosines) + 
  geom_col(aes(album, cosines, fill=I(&quot;steelblue3&quot;), col=I(&quot;black&quot;)),show.legend = F) +
  theme_bw() + coord_flip() + 
  labs(title = &quot;Cosine similarities with Please Please Me&quot;, y = &quot;cosine similarity&quot;) + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1.25))) + 
  ylim(0,1)

<p>It is not surprising that &lsquo;A Hard Day&rsquo;s Night&rsquo; is very similar to Please
Please Me, but Abbey Road (no. 12) also shares a lot with it.
Sgt.¬†Pepper&rsquo;s (no. 8) is an interesting album: it is the most distinct
one amongst the core and, as we will see it later, by some measure it
has more complex lyrics than any of the other LPs. (St.¬†Pepper&rsquo;s was the
first album of the &lsquo;studio years&rsquo;, when the band was finally freed from
the burden of permanent touring. It was an experimental album which took
700 hours to record.)
<br><br></p>

<h2 id="text-complexity">Text Complexity</h2>

<p>Next I turned to text complexity. Can we see an arch of change as the
group gets older, grows confidence, and starts to have something else to
say than &lsquo;I love you&rsquo;?</p>

<p>There are various measures of text complexity, and all aims to assess
the readability of prosaic test. Since these metrics have been developed
to prose, applying them to lyrics, which is basically poetry, is not
straightforward. In songs and poems text serves the melody (rhythm),
and, for the lack of proper punctuation, standard algorithms cannot
detect where sentences start and end. The basis of complexity metrics is
usually the number of words in a sentence, the lengths of the words, and
the ratio of complex words within all words. These measures are focusing
on how the text is built, and they don&rsquo;t filter for stop words, as the
use of these stop words is also a sign of sophistication. These are,
obviously, the simplest measures and they do not account for other
dimensions of complexity, like the frequency with which people use these
words or the types of texts where these words are typical. By these
metrics, for instance, the word &lsquo;championship&rsquo; is way more elaborate
than the word &lsquo;cat&rsquo;, although the context where the former is mostly
used may not be more academic than the one for the latter.</p>

<p>In this exercise I use the modified version of two complexity measures.
The &lsquo;<strong>Automated Readability Index</strong>&rsquo; uses characters, words and
sentences so, that</p>

ARI = 4.71 x (characters/words) + 0.5 x (words/sentences) - 21.43
</div>
<br>
The &lsquo;<strong>Gunning Fog</strong>&rsquo; score is based on words, sentences, and the ratio
of complex words:
<br>
<div class=text-center>
Gunning Fog = 0.4 x ( (words/sentences) + 100 x (complex words/words) )
</div>
<br>
A word is considered to be complex if it has at least 3 syllables.
Higher complexity scores indicate more complicated text.</p>

<p>Since sentences are loosely defined in lyrics, I replaced them by lines,
despite that sentences can be of multiple lines. Lines are the main
building blocks of song text, so using them as a proxy is a viable
option. As the original formulas are this way &lsquo;modified&rsquo;, I denote these
measures as mARI and mGunningFog. In this form they are probably more
imperfect as they originally are, but they do show meaningful patterns
even in our case.</p>

<p>In order to calculate these measures for each album I looped through the
album titles and selected distinct lines for analysis. The reason for
using distinct lines is that in songs lines are many times repeated for
the sake of the melody, serving as chorus, and complete verses can be
reused to fill the melody with sufficient amount of text for the vocals.</p>

<p>For the complexity metrics I used the &lsquo;syllable&rsquo; package, which produces
certain text statistics from which these scores can be calculated. The
result is in the next chart.</p>

<pre><code class="language-.r">text_complexity &lt;- data.table(album = character(),
                              mGunningFog = numeric(),
                              mARI = numeric())

for(i in 1:nrow(beatles_albums)){
  name &lt;- beatles_albums[[1]][i]
  l &lt;-  list(name)
  temp_lyr &lt;- beatles_lyrics %&gt;%
    filter(album == as.character(name)) %&gt;%
    distinct(text)
  rwstat &lt;- readability_word_stats(temp_lyr[,1])
  l &lt;-  list.append(l, 0.4*(rwstat$n.words/nrow(temp_lyr)) +
                      100*(rwstat$n.complexes/rwstat$n.words))
  l &lt;- list.append(l, 4.71*(rwstat$n.chars/rwstat$n.words) +
                     0.5*(rwstat$n.words/nrow(temp_lyr)) - 21.43)
  text_complexity &lt;- rbind(text_complexity, l)
}

ggplot(data = text_complexity, aes(mARI, mGunningFog)) + 
  geom_point(color = &quot;darkblue&quot;) +
  geom_text(aes(x = mARI, y = mGunningFog, label = album), hjust=1, vjust=-0.5) + 
  theme_bw() + labs(title = &quot;Text complexity of Beatles albums&quot;) + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1.25)))  +
  ylim(4,8) + xlim(-3,1)
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/img/02_beatles_03.jpg" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>While the two metrics put the albums in slightly different orders, the
trend is obvious. The first albums (Please Please Me, A Hard Day&rsquo;s
Night, With The Beatles) are of fairly simple text, but as time goes by
sophistication increases. Let It Be (no. 13) and Abbey Road (no. 12)
have fairly high readings by ARI, and Let It Be is the single most
complex according to Gunning Fox. Note that Sgt.¬†Pepper (no. 8) is of
relatively high complexity: it is the most complex by ARI and the third
most complex by Gunning Fog. Remember, Sgt.¬†Pepper is the most
dissimilar album compared to the Please Please Me benchmark by cosine
similarity.</p>

<p>If we look at the publication dates of these albums (not shown here) we
do see a development in the group&rsquo;s artistic performance. Four out of
the last five albums (&lsquo;Magical Mystery Tour&rsquo;, &lsquo;The Beatles The White
Album&rsquo;, &lsquo;Abbey Road&rsquo;, &lsquo;Let It Be&rsquo;) are in the top right corner of the
chart, while the first five LPs are in the bottom left.
<br><br></p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>This short analysis tries to provide an insight into the carrier of The
Beatles through their lyrics. Songs were very simple at the beginning,
but as their music got more mature, their lyrics followed on. Measures
of text complexity, just as those of similarity, can also reveal the
uniqueness of the St.¬†Pepper&rsquo;s album.</p>

<p>Among the tools, tidytext, syllable, and of course the geniusR packages
were used to compile this report.</p>
